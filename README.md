# CRISPR-GPT: An LLM Agent for Automated Design of Gene-Editing Experiments

![CRISPR-GPT Logo](path/to/logo.svg)

CRISPR-GPT is an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to automate and streamline the process of designing gene-editing experiments. By leveraging the power of advanced language models, CRISPR-GPT assists researchers in planning, executing, and analyzing CRISPR-based gene editing tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy.

## Demo

[Insert demo image or video showcasing how the agent works]

This demo shows how CRISPR-GPT assists in automating the design of a CRISPR knockout experiment, allowing users to quickly transition between different stages of setup, execution, and data collection.

Our CRISPR-GPT agent guides users through the complex process of designing gene-editing experiments, from selecting target sequences to optimizing guide RNAs and predicting off-target effects. The demo above illustrates the step-by-step interaction between the user and the AI agent, highlighting its ability to provide expert-level assistance in real-time.

## Roadmap

We are committed to continuously improving CRISPR-GPT and expanding its capabilities. Our roadmap includes:



- **Support for New CRISPR Methods and Workflows**: examples are we are working on Cas13-based RNA-editing.
- **Improved LLM via User/Expert Feedback**: Enhancing AI performance through fine-tuning with CRISPR-specific datasets, your expertise and feedback needed so please sign up for testing CRISPR-GPT as noted above.
- **User Interface Upgrades**: Creating a more intuitive and customizable front end for managing experiments.
- **Integration with Lab Automation**: Facilitating hands-on execution of experiments using robotics and lab automation tools.
- **Integration with Lab Notebook**: Developing APIs for integration with existing laboratory information management systems (LIMS).

We value user feedback and will be actively incorporating suggestions from the research community to make CRISPR-GPT an indispensable tool in gene editing research.

## Prerequisites

To use CRISPR-GPT, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for LLM interactions)
- Gradio (for front-end interface if you'd like to test locally)
- Required Python libraries (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)
